These callbacks were originally made by [xander1998](https://github.com/xander1998 "xander1998's Github") and I came across these inside [DRP](https://github.com/OfficialDarkzy/DRP-Core "DRP Framework by Darkzy") ([cfx.re post](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-drp-fivem-framework-core/1049607 "DRP Forum Post")). I have gotten permission to post our edits (**) to it from Xander.

### <p align="center">[Information]</p>

I have removed the callbacks from our frameworks core and made them standalone. Aside from the edits (**) listed above, some other minor changes were done in order to itegrate it into our codebase.  
I have also used this standalone version in various places within our framework (replacing the callbacks inside our core) for testing and it works perfectly! The example code given also works without issues.  
It's like 2head simple and should work out of the box as long as you have at least 1 brain cell.

Drop it inside your server's resources folder and ensure it in the cfg. Done. Now isn't that just ezclap??
